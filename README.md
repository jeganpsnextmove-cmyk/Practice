# Practice
In this we have stored the word reverse strings in diff array and printed
We found the issue of , it printing only the first string - understood it is because of length calculated before certain important piece of code
We made the change that resolves copying null to array 
Also we learnt the importance of memcpy and memset
memcpy - to copy the memory as it is to the destination [syntax - memcpy(dst,src,size)
memset - to set null to the array to avoid garbage values [syntax - memset (dst,0,size)
